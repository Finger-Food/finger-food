## Hello visitor 🌊, my name is Kris Parekh and welcome to my fledgling GitHub

### About me
I'm from Sydney Australia, the beaches are nice but I think snow is nicer ❄️. Though C++ is cool, and Java is suave, Python is where journey began 🐍. I like writing clean, robust code ✨, but outside of that my time is spent satiating curiosity and enjoying the little moments ☺️.
