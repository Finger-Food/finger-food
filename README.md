## Hello visitor 🌊, my name is Kris Parekh and welcome to my fledgling GitHub

### About me
I'm a University of Sydney studied computer scientist from Australia, though beaches are nice but I say snow is nicer ❄️. C++ is cool and Java is suave, but Python is where my journey began 🐍. When I'm not writing clean, robust code...and receding my hairline on bugs 🐛, my time is spent maintaining the body, satiating curiosity, and enjoying the little moments ☺️.
