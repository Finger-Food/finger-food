## Hello visitor 🌊, my name is Kris Parekh and welcome to my fledgling GitHub

### About me
I'm from Sydney Australia, the beaches are nice but I think snow is nicer ❄️. Though C++ is cool and Java is suave, Python is where journey began 🐍. When I'm not writing clean, robust code ✨ ...and receding my hairline on bugs 🐛, my time is spent maintaining the body, satiating curiosity, and enjoying the little moments ☺️.
